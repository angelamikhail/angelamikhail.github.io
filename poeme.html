    <h1> A Day Away</h1> 
    <h3> By Brian E Pardee</h3>
    <p> Some feelings are shallow, some feelings are deep.<br>
Some make us smile, some make us weep.<br>
<br>
Some we love, some we don't.<br>
Some we'll savor, some we won't.<br>
<br>
Some grounding, some uplifting,<br>
Some long-lasting, some constantly shifting.<br>
<br>
No matter what feelings I'm feeling today,<br>
I know tomorrow is only a day away.</p>
